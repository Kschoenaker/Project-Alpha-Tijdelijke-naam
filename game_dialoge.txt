"You wake up to a world on the edge of ruin.
Whispers of giant spiders invading the land echo through every village and forest path. Crops are withering, people are disappearing, and fear spreads like poison.

But not all hope is lost.

You have the freedom to go where you're needed—help struggling townsfolk, complete quests, uncover hidden secrets, and grow stronger with every challenge.

Every step you take brings you closer to the truth… and to the power you'll need to stop the swarm.

The spiders are coming.
Will you be ready?"




quest 1 
"Those filthy rats are chewing through my herbs! I can't brew a single potion with them running around. Please, clear them out before they ruin everything!"

"You actually did it! The garden's safe, and my herbs are intact for now, at least. Thank you, truly. Here, take this it's not much, but it's well-earned."

(You receive 25 gold and a Minor Healing Potion.)
quest 2
"Snakes. Dozens of 'em. Slithering through my fields like they own the place. I can't harvest a thing with them out there. If you’ve got a weapon and a spine, I could use your help."
"Well I’ll be... You actually cleared 'em out! The field’s mine again — thanks to you. I owe you more than just coin, but this’ll have to do for now. Come back anytime, friend."
(You receive 30 gold and some Fresh Produce.)

quest 3

"Spider silk is rare… and incredibly valuable. I need it for a special order, but I won’t step one foot near that cursed forest. Bring me some, if you dare — and I’ll make it worth your while."

"You actually brought it back... intact! Remarkable. This silk will weave the finest thread in the realm. I knew you had the nerve for it. Thank you you have saved the village, you will always be our hero.
