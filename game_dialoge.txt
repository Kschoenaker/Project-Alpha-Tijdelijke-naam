"You wake up to a world on the edge of ruin.
Whispers of giant spiders invading the land echo through every village and forest path. Crops are withering, people are disappearing, and fear spreads like poison.

But not all hope is lost.

You have the freedom to go where you're needed—help struggling townsfolk, complete quests, uncover hidden secrets, and grow stronger with every challenge.

Every step you take brings you closer to the truth… and to the power you'll need to stop the swarm.

The spiders are coming.
Will you be ready?"
